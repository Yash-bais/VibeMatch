Vibe Matcher Notebook

This project is a prototype semantic search engine, the "Vibe Matcher Notebook," built for an internship screening task.

It uses Pandas for data preparation, the OpenAI API (text-embedding-ada-002) to create vector embeddings for products, and scikit-learn's cosine_similarity to find the top-3 products that match a "vibe" query (e.g., "energetic urban chic").

The notebook also includes evaluation metrics, latency plotting, and a fallback for "no-match" queries.
